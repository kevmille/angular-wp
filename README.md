# Angular + Headless WordPress
In this demo I learned how to integrate Headless WordPress with Angular using Rest API. I later got Tailwind CSS to work.

You will get a "any" type error. To resolve this, change the configuration in tsconfig.json:

- Disable "strict" : true;
- Enable "noImplicitAny": false

# angular-wp
